"""
The contract a race detector implements to be scored against this corpus.

Detectors differ in two ways that both have to be absorbed here, because a
corpus that assumes either one ends up serving exactly one tool:

**When they consume.** A static analyzer reads a code object and never runs it.
A dynamic one needs a linked executable and a launcher. So an adapter is handed
every artifact level and decides for itself what to do with them, rather than
being called back inside a run the corpus orchestrates.

**What they detect.** Detectors cover different resources and different hazard
kinds, and the two do not factor into independent sets. rocjitsu's
``race_detector`` finds WAW on registers but not on LDS, so a detector's
capability is a set of ``(resource, kind)`` *pairs*; treating it as
resources x kinds would claim LDS WAW support it does not have. Every mutant
carries the pair it injects, every detector declares the pairs it supports, and
cases outside the intersection are skipped and dropped from the denominator --
never recorded as misses.

Resource and hazard names here are the corpus's own, not any one detector's
internal spelling. Adapters map them onto their tool's vocabulary.

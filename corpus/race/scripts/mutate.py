"""
Assembly mutation engine for the race corpus.

Two mutation kinds turn a correct kernel into one with a known injected defect:

``wait``
    Replace one ``s_wait_*`` with ``s_nop``. Whatever that wait was ordering is
    now unguarded, so a detector should report a hazard at that point.

``memory``
    Rewrite one sub-dword load as a store to the same address. A byte *read*
    turned into a byte *write* is the single edit that makes an otherwise
    race-free all-reads kernel racy, since the new writer must race the byte's
    foreign readers.

A mutation is identified by its **ordinal** -- its index into the sites this
module finds, in the order it finds them -- rather than by a line number. The
ordinal is stable across toolchains in a way a line number is not, which is what
lets a recipe committed in ``mutants.toml`` be applied to assembly generated
fresh by whatever compiler is present.

This module is deliberately free of any simulator, detector, or ROCm dependency:
it reads text and writes text. Everything that knows about a particular tool
lives in ``adapters/``.
